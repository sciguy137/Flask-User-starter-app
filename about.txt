Prediction Tycoon: Prediction markets may be considered the "Holy Grail" of Predictive Analytics. Harnessing the wisdom of crowds in the same way as financial markets could prove extremely valuable to both industry (e.g. "Will 1-inch stilettos be more popular than 2-inch stilettos this summer?") and policy makers (e.g. "Will Nevada residents use more than 30 billion gallons of water this month?"). Heavy regulations, particularly in the U.S., prevent traditional currency-based prediction markets from gaining traction. Turning prediction markets into a game using virtual (.i.e. fake) currency with selected incentives, however, could be key to making these kinds of predictions a reality. Determining prediction reliability and biases resulting from incentives, etc., will require the creative work of data scientists.
